        "As you can see, every node in graph represents an operation or an input and every edge, which in TensorFlow we call a tensor, represents the data flow between these nodes (so in case you wonder where the name TensorFlow comes from, this is your answer). Almost every mathematical expression can be shown like this and it is not limited to neural networks. In a TensorFlow prgoram, we are simply creating a computational graph, hence we can benefit using TensorFlow in computing any kind of mathematical expression.\n",

Using this graph form allows us to find these independent operations and compute their results in parallel. \n",

For example, if we ask for the output of ADD node, it is the responsibility of the distributed master to recongnize that just the output of MUL operation is needed and prune other unnecessary nodes.
