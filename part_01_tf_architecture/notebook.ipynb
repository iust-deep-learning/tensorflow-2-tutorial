        "As you can see, every node in graph represents an operation or an input and every edge, which in TensorFlow we call a tensor, represents the data flow between these nodes (so in case you wonder where the name TensorFlow comes from, this is your answer). Almost every mathematical expression can be shown like this and it is not limited to neural networks. In a TensorFlow prgoram, we are simply creating a computational graph, hence we can benefit using TensorFlow in computing any kind of mathematical expression.\n",

        "</br>\n",
        "The reason lies in the fact that some of our operations have nothing to do with each other and are completely independent. For example, in this case, two additions are independent. Using this graph form allows us to find these independent operations and compute their results in parallel. \n",
        "</br>\n",
        "Besides, recall the fact that nural networks use **back propagation** to optimize the loss function and this algorithm uses **chain rule** to compute the drivatives of loss function with respect to hidden variables. Therefore, TensorFlow benefits from this graph form which makes implementation of back propagation much easier.\n",

For example, if we ask for the output of ADD node, it is the responsibility of the distributed master to recongnize that just the output of MUL operation is needed and prune other unnecessary nodes. Besides that, distibuted master finds graph pieces which are independent and can be evaluated in parallel.\n",
